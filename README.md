## Project Background
 Project Background & Overview (The Business Story)
​Metro Bank is a high-street retail bank dedicated to providing personalized service alongside modern financial products. Like many growing institutions, Metro Bank faces the constant challenge of balancing rapid customer acquisition, maintaining profitability across a large branch network, and minimizing risk from fraud and service failures.
​This project originates from a genuine need for executive leadership to move past siloed reports. The objective was to create a single source of truth—a comprehensive, 5-page analytical dashboard built in Advanced Microsoft Excel—that integrates the entire customer and operational journey.

The analysis is structured around the following Key Business Questions:

* **Customer Segmentation:** Who are our most valuable customer segments (e.g., Boomers vs. Millennials, Corporate vs. Retail)?

* **​Product Health:** How are our core products (Savings, Checking, Loans, Credit Cards) performing, and what is the typical customer relationship?
  
* **Operational Efficiency:** Which branches are the most profitable, and how can we optimize staff allocation?

*  **Risk & Trust:** What are the primary sources of customer complaints and fraud exposure, and how quickly are we resolving them?

​Tools & Technologies
​Primary Tool: Microsoft Excel (Advanced)
​Techniques: Excel Data Model (Power Pivot), Custom Calculated Measures/Fields, Pivot Tables, Advanced Conditional Formatting, and multi-sheet dashboard integration.
